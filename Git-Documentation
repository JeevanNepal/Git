Steps to push files/ code in existing repository.

1. git init
2. add the files: git add . / name of the particular file.
3. open the file in notepad: notepad (file name)/ in visual studio code.
4. commit to the repository: git commit -m "...."
5. git checkout : to add new branch for easy push.
6. git branch : to check in which branch you are currently.
7. connect to the repository:git remote add origin(url of your repository).
8. git push origin (name of the branch that you have recently created)/ -f is a wrong option as it pushed by force even 
    if the code is wrong.
9. Pushing by making a new-branch is the right way as it does not give any errors while pushing the code.
