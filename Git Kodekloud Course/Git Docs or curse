Git is a disrtibuted version control system.

Distributed: It simply means that is has a remote repository which is stored in server and on local computer as well.

Git has 2 repositories:
  1. Local
  2. Remote.
  
  What is a commit?
  A commit stores a copy of the file in it's current state.
  
  git commit -m "Committed a file" -m avoids us to ot to open the text editor.
  
  
  
  To restore the file or version to previous version simply run git restore and file name. (git restore jeevan.txt)
  
  we can cached the file to retain it if it's removed from the repository by using command as git rm --cached file name.

to not to accidently commit the cached fine use gitignore command and store the file in .gitignore file. (echo file name >> .gitignore)

A branch is a pointer to the last commit.

To delete a branch use got branch -d branch name.


To count the number of branch in git just run the git branch command.


Merge in Git:
1. Fast-forward merge : It's a merge if there is no extra rather then previou commits.
   ex: git mereg file name(jeevan/signup)
   
2. No-fast-forward merge: It commits in active branch/ create a commit in merging branch.
   ex: 




Remote Repository:

We use connection string to push or pull to or from remote repository usig the path.

To add to local machine: git remote add file name(origin) followed by the connection string.
We can list all the remote repositories with: git reote -v


To push the code to remote repository: git push origin(aleas) master(branch)
